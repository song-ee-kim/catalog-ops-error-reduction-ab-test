# Catalog Ops Error Reduction via A/B Testing

## Overview
This project analyzes catalog labeling errors using simulated operation logs.
The objective is to identify error patterns among operators and validate SOP
improvements through controlled A/B testing.

## Problem Statement
In catalog operations, labeling errors negatively impact search quality,
recommendation accuracy, and downstream operational costs.

## Approach
- Designed simulated catalog operation logs reflecting operator experience levels
- Defined error rate as a core accuracy metric
- Identified higher error rates among new operators
- Conducted A/B testing within the same population to validate SOP improvements

## Key Results
- Reduced error rate from **15.4% to 11.3%**
- Achieved **27% relative error reduction**

## Methods & Tools
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Error rate metric design
- A/B testing
- SOP-based process improvement

## Notes
This project uses **simulated data** designed to reflect real-world
e-commerce catalog operations.
